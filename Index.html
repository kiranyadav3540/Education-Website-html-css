                    in a positive frame of mind, you can make better decisions. You can look ahead and plot a course,
                    rather than just reacting to the setbacks you encounter. You
                    don't get stuck with negative self-talk.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in
                low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in
                developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and
                higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be under
                represented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income
                families.The report showed some cases
                of successful voucher where there was an oversupply of quality private places and an efficient
                administrative authority and of subsidy programs. Evaluations of the effectiveness of international
                support to the sector are rare.[63] Addressing
                regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of
                understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and
                accountability between users, government,
                and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.[</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or
                almost free full courses, through open education, such as Harvard, MIT and Berkeley teaming up to form
                edX. Other universities offering open education are prestigious private
                universities such as Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, the University of Pennsylvania, and
                Caltech, as well as notable public universities including Tsinghua, Peking, Edinburgh, University of
                Michigan, and University of Virginia.The
                subject areas most commonly associated with career and technical education are: business (office
                administration, entrepreneurship); trade and industrial (e.g., automotive technician, carpenter,
                computer numerical control technician); health
                occupations (nursing, dental, and medical technicians); agriculture </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Open education has been called the biggest change in the way people
                learn since the printing press.[40] Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still
                desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural
                reasons.[41] Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized
                testing and traditional degrees and credentials.[42] The conventional merit-system degree is currently
                not as common in open education as
                it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such
                as the Open University in the United Kingdom. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer
                their own form of certificate.</p>
